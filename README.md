# Dynamic Channel Selection in Self-Supervised Learning]

This is a official Pytorch based implementation of [Dynamic Channel Selection in Self-Supervised Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2207.12065) accepted in [IMVIP 2022](https://imvipconference.github.io/). Code from channel gating is derived from https://imvipconference.github.io/ while we train the self-supervised approach based on [Solo-learn library](https://github.com/vturrisi/solo-learn).
